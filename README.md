# gum
Treat your friends with some chewing gum. Try giving them as little as possible to treat as many as possible.

Press and hold LPM to shake the pack of gum -> Holding LPM increases stress over time.

Release when the indicator is in the green zone, to give only one gum.

Anything above green will result in giving out more gum than intended -> Increases stress.

Anything below will yield no gum and make you look like a stingy dork -> Increases stress.

High stress levels will make your hands shaky, making it harder to deliver the intended amount of gum.
